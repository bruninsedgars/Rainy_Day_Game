# Rainy_Day_Game
first game 
moving animated background with houses, cars, and trees. The character jumps to avoid obstacles and gets tools or objects to stay dry
(an umbrella, raincoat, TukTuk, a bus, or a car), if scores are good, then at some point sunny weather shows up from time to time.
Character does salto to as an additional feature). 
On display, there is a scale (level of dryness of the character). 
For the background sound will use "pixel music", 
as well as "folly sound" to emphasize sound effects (fails or scores).
