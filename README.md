# Rainy_Day_Game
first game 
The character jumps to avoid obstacles and gets tools or objects to stay dry
(an umbrella, raincoat, TukTuk, a bus, or a car), if scores are good, then at some point sunny weather shows up from time to time.
The character can do saltho as an additional feature). As background is used parallax effect image (horizontally moving city view, with houses,  traffic, and raindrops).
On display, there is a scale (level of dryness of the character). 
For the background sound will use "pixel music", 
as well as "folly sound" to emphasize sound effects (fails or scores).
